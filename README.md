**1. Directory Structure:**

- **`data/` Directory:** This folder is designated for storing data files utilized by the application.
- **`logs/` Directory:** This directory contains log files generated during the application's runtime, aiding in monitoring and debugging processes.

**2. Core Python Modules:**

- **`main.py`:** This script defines two primary classes:
  - **`EditorSession`:** Manages text editing operations, including viewing, creating, replacing strings, and inserting content into files.s
  - **`BashSession`:** Handles the execution of Bash commands, allowing for command execution within the application's environment.

  Both classes utilize the `anthropic` API for processing user inputs and generating appropriate responses. Additionally, a `SessionLogger` class is implemented to log activities and track token usage, which is crucial for monitoring API interactions and associated costs.

- **`app.py`:** This script serves as the entry point for the web application, built using the Streamlit framework. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the key-value store. Key functionalities include:

  - **Command Input:** Users can input commands to perform operations such as inserting, updating, or retrieving key-value pairs.
  - **Feedback Display:** The application processes user commands and displays feedback or results accordingly.
  - **Database State Visualization:** The current state of the key-value store is presented in a tabular format, offering a clear view of stored data.
  - **Log Analysis:** The application analyzes log files to display a histogram of log entries by hour, providing insights into usage patterns.

**3. Data Management:**

The application reads from and writes to a JSON Lines (`.jsonl`) file located in the `data/` directory. This file acts as the persistent storage for the key-value pairs managed by the application.

**4. Logging Mechanism:**

A robust logging system is implemented to capture and store logs in the `logs/` directory. This system is essential for tracking application behavior, debugging, and analyzing usage patterns over time.

**5. External Dependencies:**

The application relies on several external libraries, including:

- **`anthropic`:** Utilized for processing user inputs and generating responses.
- **`streamlit`:** Employed to create the web-based user interface.
- **`pandas`:** Used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly in handling the key-value store and log data.

*PROMPTS USED*
```
BASH_SYSTEM_PROMPT = os.environ.get(
    "BASH_SYSTEM_PROMPT", "You are a helpful assistant that can execute bash commands."
)
EDITOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT = os.environ.get(
    "EDITOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT",
    "You are a helpful assistant that helps users edit text files.",
)
```

*Sample requests and responses:*

Request1 :
```
count the total  key value psirs in the data.jsonl file
```
Response1 :
```
Based on the file contents, I can count:
•⁠  ⁠Each line represents a JSON object
•⁠  ⁠Each JSON object has 4 key-value pairs: Key, Value, Created datetime, and Updated datetime
•⁠  ⁠There are 9 lines in total

Therefore:
Total key-value pairs = Number of lines × Key-value pairs per line
Total key-value pairs = 9 × 4 = 36 key-value pairs

The data.jsonl file contains a total of 36 key-value pairs as of 17/11/2024 12:36:23.
```

Request 2 :
```
Insert an entry with "Key": "server.config", "Value": "production" into the output.jsonl
```
Response 2 :
```
Now the entry has been properly added with the correct formatting. The file has been updated successfully with the new configuration entry.
```

## Backend System Deliverables:
  - Key-Value Store: We have used the `jsonl` file format to store the entries. Each entries take up one line. And has the following columns: Key, Value Created datetime, Updated datetime
  - We have created some file tool handles to perform the CRUD operations on the files, as well as to analyze them:
  ```
  def _handle_view(self, path: str, _: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Handle view command"""
        editor_path = self._get_editor_path(path)

        os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(path), exist_ok=True)
        with open(path, "w") as f:

        insert_line = tool_call["insert_line"]
        if insert_line > len(lines):

        lines.insert(insert_line, tool_call["new_str"] + "\n")

            f.writelines(lines)
        return {"content": "Content inserted successfully"}

    def log_to_session(self, data: Dict[str, Any], section: str) -> None:
        """Log data to session log file"""

    def handle_text_editor_tool(self, tool_call: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Handle text editor tool calls"""
        try:
            # Get path and ensure directory exists
            path = self._get_editor_path(tool_call["path"])

            handlers = {
                "view": self._handle_view,
                "create": self._handle_create,
                "str_replace": self._handle_str_replace,
                "insert": self._handle_insert,
            }

            handler = handlers.get(command)
            return handler(path, tool_call)

        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Error in handle_text_editor_tool: {str(e)}")
            return {"error": str(e)}
  ```







In summary, the `hack_iu` repository offers a comprehensive solution for managing a key-value store through a web interface, integrating text editing and Bash command execution capabilities, all while maintaining detailed logging for monitoring and analysis purposes.
